### **What Nerv DAO Has Accomplished So Far**

Currently, Nerv DAO has successfully built and deployed a platform that integrates wallet abstraction with a wide range of wallets, including MetaMask, Unisat, OKX Wallet, and passkey wallets like JoyID. This functionality allows users from different blockchain ecosystems to easily interact with the Nervos DAO, making it a versatile and accessible solution for protecting CKBytes. Nerv DAO has also ensured that its interface is user-friendly and secure, making it simpler for users to manage their DAO interactions while safeguarding their investments.

### **Whatâ€™s Next for Nerv DAO**

Looking ahead, Nerv DAO is set to introduce several new features and enhancements to further benefit the CKB community:

- **UI Optimization**: Ongoing improvements to the user interface will ensure that Nerv DAO remains intuitive and accessible, even as new features are added. The goal is to provide a seamless experience for both new and experienced users.
- **NFT Credentials**: Nerv DAO is exploring the integration of NFT credentials as a way to provide users with unique, verifiable identities and access rights within the platform. These NFT credentials could be used to represent user achievements, participation in specific events, or even governance rights within the DAO ecosystem. This feature aims to enhance user engagement and bring an additional layer of security and personalization to the Nerv DAO experience.
- **Expanded Wallet Compatibility**: Nerv DAO will continue to expand its compatibility with more wallets across various blockchain ecosystems, ensuring that users have a broad choice of platforms to interact with the Nervos DAO.

5. **Earn Rewards**: Once your CKBytes are locked in the Nervos DAO, you will start earning rewards based on the amount deposited.
6. **Redeem CKBytes**: If you want to stop staking and get your CKBytes back, you can Redeem your Ckbytes(But a locking period will be applied to determine when exactly the tokens can be withdrawed)


### ** How does the NervDAO/NervosDAO Annual Yield Rate (APY) work?
When you deposit CKB in the NervosDAO, those funds are locked in a smart contract for at least ~1 month and will earn interest immediately.
The Annual Yield Rate (APY) automatically compounds, therefore, you do not need to withdraw and redeposit funds at the end of the month to gain compounding interest.
Since NervosDAO is not staking in the traditional sense, but acts as an inflation shelter, the earned interest is automatically compounded upon withdrawing funds.
The smart contract that locks your funds into the NervosDAO calculates the following:
When you deposited the funds in the Nervos DAO.
When the withdrawal request was made.
Calculate the rewards and compounding interest for the period.


### **How to Deploy Nerv DAO**

If you are a developer and would like to deploy Nerv DAO yourself, follow these steps:

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run the following commands to install the necessary packages:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    
    ```
    
3. **Build the Project**: After installing dependencies, build the project with:
    
    ```bash
    npm run build
    
    ```
    
4. **Run the Development Server**: Finally, start the development server in development mode:
