## What is Nervos DAO

Nervos DAO is a secure and decentralized system designed to protect users’ CKBytes from inflation. By depositing CKBytes into the Nervos DAO, users help ensure the security of the Nervos Network while earning rewards. Deposits into the DAO involve locking CKBytes into a special “Nervos DAO” cell, and the rewards are calculated based on the amount locked minus a small amount required to store the cell. Nervos DAO allows users to participate in securing the network while mitigating the effects of inflation.



## Open-Souce Culture of CKB

The Nervos ecosystem is built on a strong foundation of open-source development and community collaboration. CKB (Common Knowledge Base) encourages developers worldwide to contribute to the evolution of its technology. The open-source culture fosters innovation, transparency, and the rapid development of tools and protocols, ensuring that Nervos continues to grow and adapt to the needs of the broader blockchain community. This vibrant open-source culture has fostered the creation of developer tools and code examples such as CCC, BTC-FS (from the Nervape Team), UTXO Global, and JoyDAO, all of which significantly enhance the CKB user and developer experience.

**A special thank you goes to Tea, a dedicated community developer whose hard work and commitment were instrumental in bringing JoyDAO to life.** Building on Tea’s foundation, Nerv DAO will continue to evolve, offering even more comprehensive features to benefit the entire CKB community.
